ðŸš€ Rocket Launch Simulator
Final Project for CSC 2280
This project simulates the launch of a model rocket based on user-provided specifications.

How to Run
To run the simulation, execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
python rocketlaunch.py
The program will prompt you for input values related to your rocket's specifications.

Example Input
Hereâ€™s an example using a rocket I worked on in high school:

Parameter	Value
Target Height	246 m
Cross-Sectional Area	0.000483 mÂ²
Mass	230 g
Ejection Delay	7 s
Motor Manufacturer	AeroTech
Motor Model	D10
Nosecone Type	Conical
Note: When entering input, do not include unitsâ€”just the numerical values.

Typical Model Rocket Specifications
Target Height: 200 - 450 meters

Cross-Sectional Area: ~0.0005 mÂ²

Mass: 200 - 400 grams

Ejection Delay: 5 - 8 seconds

About the Project
This program calculates the rocket's trajectory based on the given parameters, allowing users to adjust values and analyze how different specifications impact performance.
The audio file huston.mp3 is required to play the error message.
