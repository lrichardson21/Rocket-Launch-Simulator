Instructrions for running rocketlaunch.py

Here is example input for a rocket I worked on in highschool:
Note: This is expained when the program is run but units should not be icluded when typing in input.

Targeted height = 246 m
Cross sectional area = 0.000483 m^2
Mass = 230 g
Ejection delay = 7 s
Motor manufacturer = AreoTech
Motor model = D10
Nosecone type = conical

Any positive real numbers will work as inputs in this program, however usually model rocket specifications will be within these parameters:

Targeted height is usually between 200-450 meters
Cross sectional area is about 0.0005 meters^2
Mass is usualy from 200-400 grams
Ejection delay is usually between 5-8 seconds

The audio file huston.mp3 is required to play the error message.
